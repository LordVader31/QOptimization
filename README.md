# QCryptography
This repository contains solutions to **some** of the questions on the [archived Quantum Cryptography course](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-cryptography) by Caltech and TUDelft on edX. These are some **Julia weekly exercises** as well as some **writeups in PDFs** of the Weekly Problems. It also has some of the circuits I wrote in Qiskit as part of experimentation that I did while completing this course. The material will be sorted week-wise. The weekly material is gotten from [QuCryptoX](https://github.com/QuCryptoX)'s collection of weekly Julia exercises.  (_In progress_)
